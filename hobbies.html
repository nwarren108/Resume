        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p>I believe that it's important to not only know a potential employee in a professional sense, but it also
            helps to have a little bit of a deeper insight into their likes outside of the professional setting. I believe
            that this can make the professional relationships that we all have stronger and more personable.
